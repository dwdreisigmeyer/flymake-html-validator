;;; How to use this.
;;
;; Install validator.nu from
;;
;; http://about.validator.nu/
;;
;; You must start this running before you can use flymake.
;; The default address for validator.nu is localhost:8888.
;; If you wish to change this do:
;;
;; (setq validator-address "your-html-checker-address")
;;
;; Make sure this address is correct because flymake will not warn if it is wrong.
;; I have this installed in the same directory as the default validator-script:
;; 
;; ~/emacs.d/site-lisp/validators/
;;
;; From here cd into checker and then do:
;;
;; python build/build.py run
;;
;; By default the included php script validator-nu.php should be located
;; in "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/validators/".  That can be changed
;; by doing:
;;
;; (setq validator-script "path/to/the/script")
;;
;; Make sure to chmod +x the script.
;;
;; Add the following lines to your emacs config:
;;
;; (require 'flymake-html-validator)
;; (add-hook 'html-mode-hook 'flymake-mode)
;;
;; This worked on OS X 10.1 with Emacs 24.0.
